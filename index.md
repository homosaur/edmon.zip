# edmon.zip

an holy place

edmon.zip is the personal domain of P. Edmon Graham, longtime developer and
current digital product manager. Since 2017 I have worked at New Balance in
Boston, USA for the Team Sports division first as a Technology and Development
Lead, now as the Product Manager and Owner for Team Sports e-commerce on
Salesforce Core Commerce. I have a passion for sustainable product and am an
advocate for greater transparency and a move to a fully circular supply chain in
apparel and footwear.

I am a pro wrestling enthusiast and trained in wrestling as well. I administer
