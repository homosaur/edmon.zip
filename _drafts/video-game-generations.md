# The True List of Video Game Generations

I was listening to the Insert Credit Show episode
[The Thinking Man's Gex](https://insertcredit.com/show/297/) and a discussion
broke out about what the logically sensible video game generations are. I've had
some ideas about this since including the MiSTer in my rotation.

Generation 1: The Electronics Era (pre 2600)

Generation 2: The Home Era (2600 to pre-NES)

Generation 3: Memory Expansion Era (NES to pre-PS1)

Still writing assembly but with vastly more memory and expansion capability

Generation 4: The 3D Era (PS1 to pre-PS3)

Generation 5: The Online Era (PS3 to now)
